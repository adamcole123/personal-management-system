# 4. Contributions

## 4.1. TDD
All contributions must be created using Test Driven Development. All main folders in the application will contain a `__tests__` folder, where all tests for that folder but exist.

Steps for TDD:\
ðŸ”´ **RED** Write a failing test \
ðŸŸ¢ **GREEN** Get the test to pass by writing some logic \
ðŸŸ¡ **REFACTOR** Change the structure of code to make it more readable

## 4.2. Clean Architecture
